# arts.joomla
ARTS JOOMLA is a site for artists created on CMS Joomla.
I created it for one of my clients. It was an artist's site. It was deleted after a year, but yesterday I decided to put it on my Github as my portfolio.
When I found it in my archive, it had version 3.8. His admin panel was too ugly and old and had a lot of error messages because it doesn't support PHP 8.1.
I fixed the bugs one by one and then logged  into the admin and updated it to 3.10.
At first I can't upgrade it  to 4.1, but after downgrading my PHP to 7.4, the upgrade system finally worked.
After updating to 4.1, protostar disappeared. Thanks to my other backups, I copied protostar here again. But Joomla 4.1 doesn't provide protostar. So fixing all the bugs took too long. Now it works. And I'm pushing it here. So anyone can clone this project and try it out.
